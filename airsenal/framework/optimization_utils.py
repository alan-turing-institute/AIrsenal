    * Start with free_transfers free transfers.
    * Spend a max of max_total_hit points on transfers across whole period
    (None for no limit)
    * Allow playing the chips which have their allow_xxx argument set True
    * Exclude strategies that waste free transfers (make 0 transfers if 2 free tramsfers
    are available), if allow_unused_transfers is False.
    * Make a maximum of max_opt_transfers transfers each gameweek.
    * Each chip only allowed once.

    -------
        Tuple of int: number of strategies that will be computed, and bool: whether the
        baseline strategy will be excluded from the main optimization tree and will need
        to be computed separately (this can be the case if allow_unused_transfers is
        False). Either way, the total count of strategies will include the baseline.
