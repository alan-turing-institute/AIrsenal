=== ALGORITHM COMPARISON RESULTS ===

Test Configuration:
- Gameweeks: 1-3
- Budget: Â£100.0m
- Parameters tested: 50 and 100 generations with matching population sizes

RESULTS:

FIRST TEST (50 generations, 50 population):
- PYGMO (genetic): 166.49 pts
- DEAP: 168.83 pts
- DIFFERENCE: +2.34 pts in favor of DEAP (+1.4% improvement)

HIGH QUALITY TEST (100 generations, 100 population):  
- PYGMO (genetic): 175.30 pts
- DEAP: 171.94 pts  
- DIFFERENCE: -3.36 pts in favor of PYGMO (-2.0% difference)

ANALYSIS:
1. Both algorithms are competitive and can produce high-quality results
2. With smaller population/generation parameters (50/50), DEAP performed better
3. With larger parameters (100/100), PYGMO performed better  
4. The difference between algorithms is relatively small (1-2%)
5. Both algorithms successfully found solutions scoring 166-175 pts for a 3-gameweek period

CONCLUSION:
Both DEAP and PYGMO algorithms are viable options for squad optimization. The choice between them may depend on:
- Available computational time
- Desired parameter tuning
- Specific optimization preferences
- Hardware capabilities

The integration of DEAP as an alternative genetic algorithm option has been successful and provides users with more choice in optimization approaches.
