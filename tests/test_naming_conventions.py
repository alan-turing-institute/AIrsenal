"""
Enforce the naming decisions made during the refactor.

The same list of gameweeks used to travel as `gw_range`, `gameweeks`,
`gameweek_range`, `weeks_ahead` and `num_gameweeks` depending on which function
it was passed to, and the reader had to check each hop to know whether a count
or a list was meant. Renaming them once fixes today; this test is what stops
them drifting apart again.
